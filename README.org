Custom stumpwm init. Should work out of the box without any configuration other
than adding
#+begin_src lisp
in-package :stumpwm)
  
(add-to-load-path "~/.stumpwm.d/modules/stumpwm-init/")

(load-module "stumpwm-init")
#+end_src
to your ~.stumpwmrc~ (although there is some [[*Optional Configuration][optional configuration]]!).

* Features
  - Key remappings for Okular (pdf viewer) if it is installed. The bindings are
    a Spacemacs-like Emacs/vim mix (which you may not like).
  - Include a few lightweight contrib modules.
  - ~poison~ command to banish and turn off mouse (q)
  - Call xterm with the =Hack= font.
  - Use a package to keep the namespace clean, export symbols for [[*Optional Configuration][optional
    configuration]].
